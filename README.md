# Netflix-eda_recommendation-system
This project performs end-to-end analysis of the Netflix Titles dataset, uncovering trends in content, genres, and production patterns. It applies NLP techniques, including TF-IDF and LDA topic modeling, to extract dominant themes in movie/show descriptions, and builds a content-based recommendation system to suggest similar titles.
